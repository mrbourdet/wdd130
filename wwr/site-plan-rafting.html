    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this site is to provide information to novice canoers, kayakers, and rafters wanting to experience white water in a safe, controlled way.  Also, it is to provide booking/reservations online, replacing our old paper based scheduling.</p>
    <p>Our business has always been small, with most of our business coming from the New York City area and locally. Now we are seeing international interest.  We would like this site to help us grow the business.</p>


    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The website is directed to moderately affluent young to middle aged adventurists and families who want a quick weekend or day trip. Most of the boating in this area is self-directed, and though we are talking about class 1 and 2 rapids, it can still be dangerous for novices.  We cater to those wanting to enjoy a safe experience, but have little or no training.</p>
