                <h4>Lydia Anne Stewart Bourdet</h4>
                <p> Lydia was born in St. Petersburg, Florida while her mother was on vacation.</p>
                <p>Her father, Ralph Walton Stewart, a graduate of Cornell University, was a Landscape Architect.  His family roots on his father's side go back many generations in America, but originate in Scotland.  On his mother's side, the family originated in Czechoslovakia.</p>  
                <p>Lydia's mother, Ruth Elizabeth Lowe, was from a very old American family that had its roots in England and Wales. On her side of the family, she was related to Noah and Miriam Webster, the famous wordsmiths.  She was also related to the English explorer and privateer Sir Francis Drake.</p>
                <p>Her family lived in Detroit Michigan in 1930.</p>
                <p>She would visit her grandfather, F.C. Stewart in Geneva, New York in the summers.  She told of spending the summer in a big "summer" house on a lake with cousins and aunts, uncles and others.  She related a time when her grandfather, a mycologist, showed her where to find phosphorescent fungi which she used to create a skull and crossbones on the pillows of guests to the family enclave to scare them.</p> 
                <p>In 1940 she and her sister Janet were living with their maternal grandparents in Ithaca New York.  Later, she would study nursing at Syracuse University before moving to California.</p>  
                <p>By that time, her parents had divorced, and she moved to California, whence her father had moved.  He had an apartment on Geary Street in San Francisco.  She moved in with a woman named Katherine Delaney after Katherine's husband Jack had passed.  Katherine had an appliance repair business in San Jose, CA.  Lydia worked for the telephone company as an operator.</p>
